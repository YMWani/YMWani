- 👋 Hi, I’m Yashraj Wani.
- 👀 I’m interested in research in soft matter physics as well as biological physics.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on Supraparticles research from a theoretical aspect.
- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate in tandem with experimentalists in the field of soft matter physics and building theoretical
models for understanding fundamental processes in soft matter. Of course, my current research focus is on supraparticles for my PhD.
